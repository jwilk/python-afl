python-afl (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Automatically disable instrumentation when the -n option is provided.
    Setting the PYTHON_AFL_DUMB environment variable is no longer needed.
    Thanks to Michal Zalewski for the hint how to implement this feature.
  * Update the module description to stress that it's dedicated for
    pure-Python code.
